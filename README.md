# CloudComputing
Lab 1

I had difficulty understanding some instructions in this lab as the language was a bit vague, some instructions did not work on MacOS,
Azure was difficult to get running but once it worked I had less issues

Once the lab instructions were understood it was simpler to do them on the native OS and upload any changes made to github

Clearer instructions would make these labs a bit easier
